## Notes

Working with a contrained layout took some time to learn, especially when I added a border. I had to add a contrained layout within the constrained layout to have the spacing work. I spent some time deciding where to do the api call to get the video key and how to pass Movie data throughout the activties. I put the call to launching the video activity inside the success function of the video_key api call to prevent no response on click. I added more values to the movie model for ease of use.
